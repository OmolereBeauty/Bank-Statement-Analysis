Analyzing and Visualizing My Bank Account Statement: Transforming Raw Data into Actionable Insights.


I recently undertook an insightful project where I analyzed and visualized one of my bank account statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process I followed:
1. Data Collection: I downloaded the account statement from my mobile app in PDF format.

2. Data Cleaning:
âœ”Imported the bank statement into Power BI for Transformation in Power Query Editor.
âœ”I identified and addressed missing values by filling in gaps and removing irrelevant entries.
âœ”Standardized Formats: Ensured consistency in date format.
âœ”Removing Duplicates: Checked for and eliminated duplicate transactions to maintain data integrity.
âœ”Categorizing Transactions:
At this point I integrated Excel: Exported the cleaned data into Excel and used DAX formula to categorize transactions into groups such as household expenditure, loan, business, utility bills, investments and savings for more granular insights.
âœ”Pivot Table: Used pivot tables to summarize data for easier understanding and highlighting important information needed for analysis.
âœ”Re-importing Data: Saved the categorized data and re-uploaded it to Power BI to continue the analysis.

3. Data Analysis:
âœ”Expense Breakdown
âœ”Income vs. Expenses
âœ”Trend Analysis
âœ”Transaction Frequency
âœ”Cash Flow Analysis 
 
4. Data Visualization:
I created a dynamic dashboards to visualize key metrics such as total expenditure, category-wise spending, and monthly cash flow.
